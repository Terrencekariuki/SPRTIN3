            <p >Construction equipment does a great job of doing everything we need it to do without the help of any other equipment. When it comes to digging holes, grading land, moving massive material and prepping the earth for a giant project, they are the lone wolves.</p>
<p>To ensure work is done easily and well at the construction site we use some equipments such as:</p>
              
<!--list of equipments used by workers-->
                <li>cranes-used during construction of tall buildings</li>
                <li>mixers</li>
                <li>pulleys</li>
                <li>wheel barrows</li>
                <li>spades and axes</li>
                <li>lorries</li>
                <li>water tankers whenever water isn't enough</li>
                <li>pumps and generators</li>
